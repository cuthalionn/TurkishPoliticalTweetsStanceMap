# TurkishPoliticalTweetsStanceMap
The main idea of the project is the crawl recent tweets about two opposing parties and find the sentiments of the tweets to distinguish the tweets that are favoring the subject and vice versa. Finally there is another module that maps the tweets according to the userâ€™s location information on the Turkish map and saves the map as an html file.

The documentation of the code could be found at "/_build/html/index.html".
