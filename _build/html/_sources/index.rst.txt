Introduction
------------
This page is a aimed to introduce the Turkish Political Tweet Mapper project in detail and 
give documentation to the code.

The main idea of the project is the crawl recent tweets about two opposing parties and find the sentiments
of the tweets to distinguish the tweets that are favoring the subject and vice versa. Finally there is another 
module that maps the tweets according to the user's location information on the Turkish map and saves the map as an
html file.
